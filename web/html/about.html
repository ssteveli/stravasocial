<p class="lead">Who created this project?</p>
<p>
    Segment Compare is an <a href="https://github.com/ssteveli/stravasocial">open source project</a> created by <a href="http://twitter.com/ssteveli">Scott Stevelinck</a>
</p>
<p class="lead">Why?</p>
<p>
    As I entered the race scene, I wanted a way to compare myself against other athletes registered in the same race without the clicky clicky work of navigating Strava.
</p>
<p class="lead">Any other reasons?</p>
<p>
    I wanted to learn a few new technologies for a new job I'm starting soon, so keep your comments to yourself about the code. ;)
</p>
<p class="lead">Can I find you on Strava?</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/2298968">Yep.</a>
</p>
<p class="lead">I'm being asked for an athlete id to compare to, how do I find that?</p>
<p>
    Visit the <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/2298968">profile page</a> of an athlete you'd like to compare against, in your browser you'll see the athlete's id as part of the URL.

<p class="lead">How does the comparison work?</p>
<p>
    Due to the way the Strava API works
    the comparison is based on the following workflow:
    <ul>
        <li>Gather your activites in the past ## (specified at runtime) of days</li>
        <li>For each activity gather segments ridden</li>
        <li>See if the athlete you're comparing against has ridden the same segment</li>
        <li>If so, gather your top time and their top time for the segment</li>
        <li>Add the segment to the results of the comparison</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="lead">Will other types of comparisons (i.e. watts/kg) be added?</p>
<p>
    I'm limited to the functionality of the Strava API.  As they expose more data, I'll add more comparisons.
</p>
<p class="lead">What does the <i>Weighted Average Difference (WAD)</i> really mean?</i></p>
<p>
    The distance WAD is weighted according to the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Less than or equal to {{804.672 | feet:measurement_preference}} = 1 point</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to {{1609.34 | feet:measurement_preference}} = 2 points</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to {{2414.02 | feet:measurement_preference}} = 3 points</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to {{3218.69 | feet:measurement_preference}} = 4 points</li>
        <li>Greater than {{3218.69 | feet:measurement_preference}} = 5 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The climbing WAD is weighted based on the segments average grade * 2</p>
    <p>
        The time difference in percentages is tallyed out and weighted against the above points.  This is the weighted average.
    </p>
</p>
<p class="lead">Well that's pretty stupid for a weighted average, I have a better idea.</i></p>
<p>
    That's awesome, always willing to listen to new ideas.  <a href="https://github.com/ssteveli/stravasocial/issues">Submit it your idea!</a>
</p>

<p class="lead">Why is running a comparison so slow?</p>
<p>
    The bottom line: I'm limited by Strava's <a href="http://strava.github.io/api/#rate-limiting">rate limiting</a>.
    This means I can invoke their API so much across yourself and all the other individuals trying to run comparisons.
    I plan on working with Strava in the future to see if I can get the rates raised for the application.

<p class="lead">Why am I limited in the number of comparisons I can run?</p>

    Did you read the question above?

<p class="lead">Can I request a feature or report a bug?</p>
<p>
    Sure, no promises I have the time... see <a href="https://github.com/ssteveli/stravasocial/issues">here.</a>
